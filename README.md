# Sales Prediction using Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a fundamental machine learning workflow to predict product sales based on advertising spending across different media channels (TV, Radio, Newspaper). The solution uses a **Linear Regression** model, a core algorithm in supervised machine learning. The entire process, from data analysis to model building and evaluation, is implemented using popular Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Matplotlib**.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares a simulated advertising dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes the relationships between advertising spend and sales.
- **Model Training:** Builds and trains a linear regression model to predict sales.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assesses the model's performance using metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **R-squared**.
- **Visualization:** Plots the data and the regression line to showcase the model's fit.
